This project investigates calcium signaling dynamics by analyzing fluorescence intensity data collected from T cells during antigen interactions. Utilizing Python, the study preprocesses data from an Excel file, focusing on Intensity Mean, Time, and TrackID metrics. The analysis includes sorting data by TrackID and Time, identifying unique TrackIDs, and generating time-series plots to visualize calcium intensity changes.

A crucial part of the study involves checking the continuity of time points within each TrackID. Gaps in time series are addressed by interpolating mean values of adjacent points. The project also categorizes cells into activated and unactivated based on calcium intensity peaks, identified using derivative analysis and thresholding techniques. Subsequently, the percentage of activated cells is calculated, and average calcium curves for activated cells are plotted with error bars to visualize the data.

This comprehensive approach integrates data manipulation with pandas, visualization with matplotlib, and custom functions for data validation. The insights gained contribute to a better understanding of calcium signaling, crucial for numerous biological processes such as T cell activation. The project underscores the importance of robust data preprocessing and analysis techniques in biomedical research.
