# Calcium Imaging Data Analysis Pipeline

### Introduction

Calcium imaging is a powerful technique used to study neuronal activity by capturing calcium ion fluctuations as proxies for action potentials. The ability to extract meaningful insights from calcium imaging data is crucial for understanding neural circuits, disease mechanisms, and drug effects. This project presents a streamlined and automated pipeline for analyzing calcium imaging datasets, facilitating efficient preprocessing, signal extraction, and feature analysis.

### Why is it Important

Understanding neural activity is critical for neuroscience research, as it provides insights into connectivity patterns in both healthy and diseased states. Calcium imaging analysis plays a crucial role in drug discovery by evaluating the effects of pharmacological interventions on neuronal behavior. Additionally, it supports disease modeling efforts, helping researchers study neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease. Given the vast amount of data generated in such studies, high-throughput analysis is essential for automating large-scale data processing, enabling efficient and scalable experimentation.
